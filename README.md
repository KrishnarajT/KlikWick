## Introduction

Another fun project, that was pending from a long time. The Inspiration behind this one is a rather prolonged one. It actually comes from a character in one of Matthew Reilly's books, Shane Schofield. He had to disable a bomb kinda thing and that needed someone to solve a software reflex barrier on some device. Me and my friend _Sreeraj_ were discussing about it and he suggested to me that it would be a good idea to make a game out of it. So here it is.

7 years later.

I agree that theres already a tonne of such reflex checkers out there. And I saw them all before making this one too. But given that it was pending from all this time, and that I needed something to practice react skills onto, I figured why not try something simple.

# Play [Here](https://klikwick.surge.sh)

Its rather simple and needs no introduction. Just visit the site and do as it says. You just gotta quickly click the screen when it turns green, or if you hear a sound.
